# DiviOps harness primer

Cross-cutting conventions every DiviOps target-coverage skill (`divi-5-builder`, `diviops-scf`, `diviops-fluentcart`, future slices) relies on. Read this when you're about to issue a `diviops_*` MCP call and want to know what the success / failure envelope looks like, how to preview a write, or which capability gate decides whether a tool is even registered for this session.

This skill carries no tool-surface documentation — tools live with the coverage slice that owns them.

## Response envelope

Every `diviops_*` tool returns the same envelope:

```jsonc
// Success
{ "ok": true, "data": <payload> }
// Failure
{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": "<code>", "message": "<human>", "hint": "<optional>", "data": <optional structured detail> } }
```

The envelope is uniform across every namespace (`page_*`, `module_*`, `preset_*`, `variable_*`, `global_color_*`, `global_font_*`, `tb_*`, `template_*`, `library_*`, `canvas_*`, `meta_*`, `schema_*`, `validate_*`, `render_*`, `scf_*`, `section_*`). Callers branch on `error.code` for failure paths; the `error.data` field carries structured detail when the failure mode needs more than a code + message.

## Standard error codes

```
not_found            404  Target ID does not resolve
invalid_input        400  Schema violation, malformed args
validation_failed    400  validate_blocks-detected shape error
conflict             409  Uniqueness collision (delete-with-references, default-preset delete, name collision, …)
capability_missing   412  Connected plugin does not advertise the required capability
forbidden            403  Row-level WordPress permission denied
wp_error             500  Underlying WordPress error
divi_error           500  Divi-specific error (block parser, validator, …)
```

`capability_missing` is the handshake-layer signal — the plugin on this site doesn't carry the capability flag the tool requires. MCP server and WordPress plugin versions are independent; install a compatible plugin component from the same DiviOps suite release or a newer supported component, then reconnect or restart the MCP session to refresh the handshake. Distinct from `forbidden` (the WP user lacks the capability on this row). Do not infer an exact required plugin version unless authoritative release-manifest evidence is actually supplied.

## Namespace-prefixed error codes

The convention is `<namespace>.<reason>` for codes that are scoped to a specific namespace and carry namespace-specific structured detail. Two flavors:

- **Gate codes** — `<ns>.not_configured`, `<ns>.capability_missing`. Pre-execution rejection by env-var configuration or handshake state.
- **Runtime codes** — `<ns>.command_failed`, `<ns>.bucket_mismatch`, `<ns>.fluid_generation_failed`, `<ns>.customizer_default_immutable`, etc. Failures that happen once the tool has begun executing.

The split matters because gate failures are environment problems (config missing, capability not advertised) — the user fixes them site-side. Runtime failures are operation problems (wp-cli exited non-zero, input shape was syntactically valid but algorithmically impossible, target row exists but is protected) — the user fixes them per-call.

Codifying `<ns>.not_configured` (gate) + `<ns>.command_failed` (runtime) as distinct codes — rather than collapsing onto `wp_error` or `capability_missing` — is the discipline. Callers branch on whether they need to surface a setup hint or a per-call recovery hint.

## Capability handshake

On MCP session start the server pings the plugin and receives a handshake payload that names which target plugins are present, which modules the user has activated, and which per-tool capabilities the plugin advertises. The server uses this to (a) gate tool registration so unsupported tools don't appear at all, and (b) gate coverage-slice skill activation so the right slice (Divi page authoring vs SCF vs FluentCart vs …) routes.

Three layers must align for a coverage slice's tools to be live in the session:

1. **Target presence** — the target plugin (Divi 5, SCF, FluentCart, …) is installed on the WP site. Detected via `class_exists()` or similar; reflected in the handshake's `available_targets`.
2. **Module activation** — the user enabled the target's module in WP admin's Modules settings page. Reflected in the handshake's `active_modules`.
3. **Project preference** — the user has not opted out of this slice for the current project on their machine. Persisted client-side; storage shape resolves during Phase B implementation.

If any layer is false, the slice declines activation even when the user's prompt matches its description. The harness primer skill (this one) does NOT have layer 1 or 2 gating — the primer's contract content is cross-cutting and load-bearing for every coverage slice's correctness, so it activates whenever any DiviOps task is detected.

The handshake does NOT carry license state. License is implicit: if the skill files are on disk, the user got them through the licensed distribution channel; if the Pro plugin is installed and active, the user got it through the licensed download.

## `dry_run` plan shape

Every mutating tool accepts an optional `dry_run: boolean` (default `false`). Read tools don't — they're already side-effect-free.

When `dry_run: true`, the tool does not mutate state. The success envelope carries a uniform plan:

```jsonc
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "dry_run": true,
    "plan": {
      "summary": "<one-line human description>",
      "changes": [
        { "kind": "<namespace>.<verb>", "target": "<resource identifier>", "before": <value|null>, "after": <value|null> }
      ],
      "warnings": [ "<optional caveat>" ]
    }
  }
}
```

Apply mode (`dry_run` omitted or `false`) keeps each tool's namespace-specific success-payload shape unchanged.

**Exceptions** — two passthrough surfaces do not accept `dry_run`:

- `diviops_meta_wp_cli` — raw passthrough; use explicit read-only commands instead.
- `diviops_scf_import` — SCF's upstream `wp scf json import` lacks a `--dry-run` flag; use `diviops_scf_sync --dry_run` for SCF-on-disk previews.

`diviops_scf_sync` flows `dry_run` through to wp-cli's `--dry-run` flag — the resulting preview is wp-cli's plain-text summary, NOT the standardized `data.plan = { summary, changes[] }` shape above. This divergence is by design because it reports the upstream SCF sync preview.

`diviops_module_update` adds a per-path `removed` array to each change entry — `[ { "path": "<leaf dot path>", "value": <what is lost> } ]` — because `before`/`after` alone can express what a path will contain but not what it will stop containing. It is always present, so an empty list means "this write removes nothing" rather than "removals were not reported". Two removals are reachable and both are caller-intended: `{"a.b.c": null}` clears a value, and a list value replaces wholesale (lists are diffed as a multiset, so replacing `["class-a","class-b"]` with `["class-c"]` reports two dropped entries rather than one, and dropping one of two identical entries is still reported).

Plugin-routed mutating tools should use the standard plan slot. Some tools also preserve route-specific diagnostics as sibling keys beside `dry_run` and `plan`, but callers should branch first on `data.plan.summary`, `data.plan.changes`, and optional `data.plan.warnings`.

## Idempotency conventions

A tool is idempotent when running it twice produces the same observable state as running it once. DiviOps tools document idempotency per-tool; the conventions:

- **`_meta.idempotent: true`** on the success payload signals a write whose repeat call would be a no-op (or a side-effect-equivalent re-apply). Documented per-tool in the tool's MCP description.
- **`annotations.idempotentHint: true`** on the tool registration is the lighter signal — declares the tool is intended idempotent without machine-checked guarantees. Useful for callers that want to retry safely without re-confirming.
- **Destructive ops on already-destructed targets** return `ok: true` with `data.already_<state>: true`, NOT `409 conflict`. `page_trash` on an already-trashed page returns `{ ok: true, data: { already_trashed: true } }`; `tb_template_trash` default mode is similarly silent-success on already-clean. The signal is preserved in the `already_<state>` flag for callers that need it. Repeat-safe semantics matter for AI agent retries.
- **Same-status no-op updates** return `ok: true` with `data.noop: true`. `page_update_status` against a post already in the target status, for example.
- **`force=true` override** — for `*_delete` tools whose default mode refuses on live-reference conflicts (`variable_delete`, `global_color_delete`, `global_font_delete`, `preset_delete`), passing `force=true` clears the conflict and proceeds. Orphan refs remain; run the corresponding `*_scan_orphans` tool to clean up afterward.

These conventions are documentation discipline, not runtime enforcement. The plugin doesn't reject a non-idempotent retry; it just guarantees the documented shape when retry is safe.

## When you'd reach for this primer

- A `diviops_*` tool returned `{ ok: false, error: { code: "scf.not_configured", … } }` and you want to know whether to surface a setup hint or a per-call recovery hint → gate code, setup-side fix.
- You're about to call a write tool and want to confirm the change before committing → pass `dry_run: true`, inspect the plan, then re-call without it.
- Two layers above MCP, an agent retries a `page_trash` call after the network blip and you want to know whether the retry will throw → idempotent on already-trashed targets, returns `already_trashed: true`.
- A coverage-slice skill mentions "the standardized envelope" and you want the canonical shape → this file is the source.

When you need the actual tool list for a specific target, route to the coverage-slice skill (`divi-5-builder` for Divi page authoring, `diviops-scf` for SCF data ops, future slices for future targets). The primer is the contract; the slice is the surface.
